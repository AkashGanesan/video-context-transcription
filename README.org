** Getting SceneGraphs.
   
   - The scenegraphs are got via a hacked library of CORENLP's
     scenegraph generator.  This will be in the local copy presented
     (bin/).  However, due to limitations of git and the lack of
     clarity on our git repository's library.

** Installation


  - Do the following to install all the requisites.  Up to date
    installation instructions on
    https://github.com/AkashGanesan/video-context-transcription

    
  - The below will take a lot of time as we need a lot of resources
    that comes along with the libraries.  (nltk, networkx, spacy are
    huge libraries and their dependencies are also very large).
  #+begin_src shell
    git clone https://github.com/AkashGanesan/video-context-transcription   
    cd video-context-transcription    
    module load python-dev/3.5.2 # Needs Python3
    virtualenv  -p python3 env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install networkx nltk numpy pathlib easydict scipy spacy
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
    python -m nltk.downloader all
  #+end_src


  - Once the above has been done, we have everything to analyze
    videos.  You can run python search.py for a demo.

    
  #+begin_src shell
    python search.py
  #+end_src
